Health Home is a web application where gym-goers and athletes can track their workout progress and food consumption, use various fitness calculators, and consult an AI chat bot regarding health related questions. Trainers can also use the web app, and can have athletes assigned to them (if the athletes so choose).  Trainers can set goals for their assigned athletes, review the activity of their assigned athletes on the app, and communicate with their assigned athletes. Athletes will have all of the functions that the gym-goers have, as well as the ability to view any trainer’s profile, communicate with any trainer, request any trainer to train them (if they are not already assigned to one), and view their assigned trainer’s goals for them. Athletes can only be assigned to one trainer at a time. Health Home will be written in Python. It will use Flask for back-end functionalities, SQLite for storage functionalities, and BotLibre for AI functionalities.
